    <h3 class="principle_title">Minimal Stress</h3>
    <p class="principle_description">
      We have enough stress in life and we don't want to add more.
      <br><br>
      The process of adding data and the way of presenting data should not make users feel stressful.
      This can be approached from many aspects and via different ways.
      Many things can cause feelings of stress such as a table or graph crammed with text and numbers,
      a task that has unnecessary steps, or a report that tells you that you have lots to change.

  <div class="principle_item">
    <h3 class="principle_title">Focus on basic things everybody does everyday</h3>
    <p class="principle_description">
      It's too complex to measure every aspect of one's life,
      but we know a few things we must do everyday and we also know they do play important roles in our overall health.
      It's impossible to dramatically change one's life by experimenting and improving these basic aspects in a short term,
      but it's also impossible not to make any advance by doing so in the long run.

  <div class="principle_item">
    <h3 class="principle_title">Care about both commonality and individuality</h3>
    <p class="principle_description">
      From the perspective of viewing ourselves as a member of human species,
      we know we thrive on the same things such as good food and good sleep.
      From the perspective of different individuals we know everyone is different,
      there's no 'average human', therefore we should not be given a scale or standard
      about what is good or bad, which could also cause stress.

    <h3 class="principle_title">Clean and expressive design</h3>
    <p class="principle_description">
      Presentation of data, designing of UI should be simple, clean, easy to understand, intuitive.
