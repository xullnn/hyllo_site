  - question: "What is the mission of Hyllo"
    answer: "Helping people improve their overall health by tending the most basic aspects of life in a heuristic and effortless way."
  - question: "Who should use Hyllo?"
    answer: "Anyone who want to improve their overall health by tending the most fundamental aspects of their life -- sleep, diet, and maybe more."
  - question: "How Hyllo works?"
    answer: "What Hyllo encourages is to first observe how sleep/diet/exercise affects your mood and energy, then try to do some experiments on one aspect, then observe again and see if improvements happen. This takes time and operate in an iterative way. And this also entails the next question."
  - question: "Who should not use Hyllo?"
    answer: "Hyllo is more suitable for people who are ready to improve their life from a long-term perspective. It is not suitable for people who habitually choose quick fix."
  - question: "Would Hyllo give suggestions or advices about sleep/diet/exercise?"
    answer: "It is best not to. One of Hyllo''s design principles is \"Care about both commonality and individuality\". Everyone is different so there is no ''universally correct'' advice for all of us. But most of us know there are some common principles about life such as: get enough sleep; don''t eat too much every meal; exercise is good. For every aspect of life, tons of resources can be found on the internet and I believe you've tried some tips before, good or bad, if you decide to take this long-term approach."
  - question: "How does Hyllo record ''what I do'' and measure ''how am I doing''?"
    answer: "Data can be biased. Abstracting one type of data implies ignoring other aspects of the fact, data is no more than a representation of certain aspects of the fact. It is impossible and overly complicated to monitor every aspect of the fact. Hyllo takes a practical way by caring either the recording of fact(photos) or the fact of yourself(how you feel)."
